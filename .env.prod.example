# Production defaults (adjust as needed)
# Prefer using a managed/host database in production.
# If the app runs in Docker and DB is on the host, set:
# HOST_DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:pass@host.docker.internal:3306/foodsafe
# Otherwise, you can still use DATABASE_URL for non-Docker runs:
# DATABASE_URL=mysql://foodsafe:secret@127.0.0.1:3306/foodsafe
